Repository structure

1. unstructured_data_analysis: This has code to classify unstructured data
2. prioritization_model: This has code to classify alerts

The repo is structured based on cookie-cutter data science template such that data artifacts, code, visualizations are organized. Also, the data science project could be deployed as a service. 

All requirement are in pyproject.toml. To reproduce the environment, run poetry. 

At this point, the code is meant to run on small data sets locally. 

TODO: Complete WIP data pipelines that can classifiy web crawl docs and extract relevant security information
